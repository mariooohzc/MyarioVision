## Motivation

As university students, we understand the challenge of crafting a resume that stands out to potential employers. Many of our peers struggle with presenting their experiences and skills effectively, often due to a lack of knowledge about professional resume formatting or the latest trends in job applications. We also recognize the stress of staying updated with job openings while balancing academic and social commitments. Inspired by these experiences and driven by our passion for coding and technology, we decided to create Rizzume, a web application designed to simplify and enhance the resume creation process.

## Aim
To provide users with a comprehensive web application that streamlines the resume creation process, offers multiple templates, generates AI-driven feedback, stores different versions of resumes securely, and keeps users updated with the latest job openings in Singapore.

## User Stories
1) As a university student looking to apply for internships, I want to input my personal details and job experience easily so that I can generate a professional-looking resume quickly.
2) As a recent graduate preparing for job applications, I want to choose from multiple resume templates to ensure my resume reflects my unique style and stands out to employers.
3) As a job seeker wanting to improve my resume, I want to receive AI-generated feedback on my resume to identify areas of improvement.
4) As a busy professional looking to manage multiple job applications, I want to store multiple versions of my resume securely and download them as needed.
5) As a job seeker staying updated with job opportunities, I want access to the latest job updates in Singapore directly from the app.
